v1.4.0 (3rd September 2010)
- correctly parse title prices that contain commans (like $2,500.00)
- fix typo in Product#to_hash
- added an experimental sinatra app for proxying and serialising API requests
- remove WWWClient

v1.3.0 (14th November 2009)
- Update handsoap dependency to >= 1.0. No issues with 0.2, it just makes sense
  to use something close to a recent version
- Remove manual string encoding fixes, handsoap now uses nokogiri for XML
  process and nokogiri returns all results as UTF-8
- Add some additional values to TitlePage::Product#to_hash()

v1.2.1 (12th October 2009)
- Update WWWCient to work with current titlepage site

v1.2 (25th July 2009)

v1.1.0 (27th May 2009)
- API CHANGE: make find method more ActiveRecord like
  - Client#find(:first, isbn)
  - Client#find(:all, isbn)
  - Client#first(isbn)
  - Client#last(isbn)
  - Client#all(isbn)

v1.0.0 (27th May 2009)
- switch from using soap4r to handsoap
  - soap4r is old, crufty, un-rubyish and currently 1.9 incompatible
  - Basic API for authenticating and searching is identical
  - API CHANGE: classes that represent matching products have had their methods
    changed to folow ruby convention

v0.9.6 (14th December 2008)
- Add gem dependency on soap4r
- Stop using a deprecated method

v0.9.5 (8th September 2008)
- Used Soap4R to regenerate our SOAP boilerplate code
  - provide access to SOAP methods that didn't exist the last time the code
    was generated
- Switch to using SearchByISBN13 instead of SearchByEAN
  - SearchByISBN13 is a mandatory field for suppliers that lists data on
    titlepage. EAN is optional, so by using SearchByEAN we were not finding all
    the titles we expected.
- Moved of of the RBook namespace

Pre v0.9.5
