v0.9.6 (14th December 2008)
- Add gem dependency on soap4r
- Stop using a deprecated method

v0.9.5 (8th September 2008)
- Used Soap4R to regenerate our SOAP boilerplate code
  - provide access to SOAP methods that didn't exist the last time the code
    was generated
- Switch to using SearchByISBN13 instead of SearchByEAN
  - SearchByISBN13 is a mandatory field for supplies that lists data on 
    titlepage. EAN is optional, so by using SearchByEAN we were not finding all
    the titles we expected.
- Moved of of the RBook namespace
