Titlepage is a service provided to the Australian book industry by the
Australian Publishers Association (APA). Suppliers and publishers list price
and availability data for thier titles, and booksellers can access the data
free of charge.

This library wraps the SOAP API in a useable object structure.

The service requires authentication, see the website for how to request
an account.

I am in no way personalyl affiliated with the APA or the Titlepage service.
